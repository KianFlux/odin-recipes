            turning to coat each piece of chicken with marinade. </li>

        <li>Place all the chicken pieces on a roasting tray and place the tray in your preheated oven. </li>
        <li>Roast the chicken for 30 minutes, remove the tray from the oven, add the corn on the cobs turning them in
            the juices, then return the tray to the oven for a further 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Arrange your selection of rice on a serving platter, top with the chicken pieces and corn on the cobs.
            Drizzle over any
