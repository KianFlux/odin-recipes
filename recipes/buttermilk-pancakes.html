    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li> ⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat together buttermilk, milk,
            eggs, and melted butter in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick water across the surface and
            if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended
            together. The
            batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>
        <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook
            until bubbles
            appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat
            with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>The most important step - serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
