    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large free range eggs</li>
        <li>6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk</li>
        <li>a knob of butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and a pinch of salt together until the
            mixture has just one consistency.</li>

        <li>Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob of butter and let it melt. Don't allow
            the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs.</li>
        <li> Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting
            and folding it over from the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>
            Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again.</li>

        <li>
            Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a
            moment to finish cooking.</li>

        <li>Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay. </li>
    </ol>
